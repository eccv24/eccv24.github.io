# Workshops - Call for Proposals


**Proposal submission deadline**: Feb 15, 2024

**Notification of acceptance**: Apr 12, 2024

**Workshop dates**: 29th, 30th of September 2024

**Location**: [https://www.micomilano.it/](MiCo Milano)


We solicit proposals for workshops that will be held together with the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) 2024 in Milano, Italy. 

We welcome proposals on emerging topics that are anticipated not to be fully explored in the main conference. The purpose of workshops is to provide a comprehensive forum and encourage in-depth discussion of various technical and application issues in our research field. Workshop registration, venue, as well as proceedings will be handled as part of the main conference by the ECCV organizers.

Since both space and time are limited, we expect the selection process to be competitive. The Chairs will evaluate the submissions on the basis of several criteria, among which are the topic coverage and relevance, the proposers’ credentials, the diversity in the organizing team and speakers, as well as the interested audience. Proposers may be asked to provide additional information, modify part of the proposals, or combine with another one.
 

The camera-ready deadline for the workshop papers is **Aug 31, 2024**.
The proposers must come with a submission/review schedule that meets this deadline if you need papers in the official proceedings. 

 
## Submission guidelines

Proposals should be in PDF format and limited to 5 pages using [https://www.overleaf.com/read/myfhwxmdfjgb](this ECCV template) (references not counted for page limit).

## Advertisement, budget & registration

Workshop organizers are responsible for the scientific organization and advertising of the event and the definition of the workshop program. ECCV local arrangements will provide and pay for rooms, coffee breaks, and A/V equipment. All other activities with budget implications are the responsibility of workshop organizers. Workshop registration will follow the passport system: ECCV attendees will register for workshops through the ECCV conference registration form.
