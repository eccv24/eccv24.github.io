# Tutorials - Call for Proposals


**Proposal submission deadline**: Feb 15, 2024

**Notification of acceptance**: Apr 12, 2024

**Workshop dates**: 29th, 30th of September 2024

**Location**: [https://www.micomilano.it/](MiCo Milano)


We solicit proposals for tutorials that will be held in conjunction with the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) 2024 in Milano, Italy. ECCV tutorials aim to provide a comprehensive overview of specific topics in computer vision. The topic should be of sufficient relevance with respect to the state of the art and the course should be educational rather than a cursory survey of techniques. The audience for ECCV tutorials consists of graduate students in computer vision as well as practitioners from different fields. Although most courses are half-day offerings (3-4 hours), we also invite proposals for full-day courses (5-7 hours) provided that the topic merits the additional time and can be anticipated to generate sufficient interest from our community. Since both space and time are limited, we expect the selection process to be competitive. The Chairs will evaluate the submissions on the basis of several criteria, among which are the topic coverage and relevance, the proposers’ credentials, the diversity in the organizing team and speakers, as well as the interested audience.

## Submission guidelines

Proposals should be in PDF format and limited to 5 pages using [https://www.overleaf.com/read/myfhwxmdfjgb](this ECCV template) (references not counted for page limit). They should be submitted to the Chairs at [http://bit.ly/eccv24-tutorial-proposals](bit.ly/eccv24-tutorial-proposals) by **Feb 15, 2024**, including the following information:


 * Tutorial title.
 * Proposers’ names, titles, affiliations and primary contact email.
 * Relevant keywords summarizing tutorial topic.
 * Short bio for each organizer, including pointers to relevant publications.
 * How diversity and inclusion in the organizing team and speakers is promoted (gender, race, seniority, affiliations, interdisciplinarity of topics and points of view). 
 * Preference for a half- or full-day event and indicative breakdown of day.
 * Course description that includes topics that will be covered, along with a brief outline.
 * Anticipated target audience (introductory, intermediate, advanced) as well as expected number of attendees.
 * Description of how this proposal relates to previous tutorials/short courses appearing at CVPR /ICCV/ECCV conferences in the previous three years.
 * Planned materials (if any) to be distributed to attendees.
