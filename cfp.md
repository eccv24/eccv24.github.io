|Computational photography|Open source tools|
|Datasets and benchmarking|Optimization methods, model fitting, and theory|
|Efficient and scalable vision|Recognition: categorization, detection, retrieval|
|Fairness, accountability, and transparency|Scene analysis and understanding|
|Generative models|Video: low-level analysis, motion, and tracking|
|Humans: biometrics, face, body, pose, gesture, movement|Video understanding|
|Learning: architectures, algorithms, formulations|Vision and other modalities|
|Learning: representations|Vision and robotics|
|Learning: semi-, meta-, weakly-, unsupervised|Vision applications and systems|

## Paper Submission
All submissions will be handled electronically via the CMT conference submission website [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ECCV2024/](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ECCV2024/). 
All authors must agree to the policies stipulated below. Papers must be registered in CMT by February 29, 2024 at 13:00 Pacific time. The submission deadline is March 7, 2024 at 13:00 Pacific time and will not be extended. Supplementary materials can be submitted until March 14, 2024 at 13:00 Pacific time.

## Policies
**General:** ECCV 2024 uses the Springer Nature Code of Conduct for Book Authors as the basis for many of the policies. We therefore urge you to familiarize yourself with these guidelines before preparing and submitting your work to ECCV 2024.

In submitting a manuscript to ECCV, the authors acknowledge that no paper substantially similar in content has been or will be submitted to another conference or workshop during the review period (March 7, 2024 â€“ July 1, 2024). Please refer to the Author Guidelines on the conference web site for additional details on dual submissions and guidelines concerning prior work.

By submitting a paper to ECCV, the authors agree to the review process and understand that papers are processed by CMT, TPMS (Toronto Paper Matching System), as well as OpenReview to match each manuscript to the best possible area chairs and reviewers. Moreover, the authors agree that papers will be checked for plagiarism using iThenticate.

The authors should be aware that each accepted paper is expected to be presented at ECCV in-person by an author (or an authorized delegate). 

All accepted papers will be made publicly available by Springer and/or the European Computer Vision Association (ECVA) no earlier than four weeks before the conference. Authors wishing to submit a patent understand that the paper's official public disclosure is four weeks before the conference or whenever the authors make it publicly available, whichever is first. 
More information about ECVA is available at [https://www.ecva.net/](https://www.ecva.net/).

## Tutorials and Workshops
In addition to the main technical program, the conference will include tutorials and workshops.
